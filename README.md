# UFA_toolbox

## Description

The UFA toolbox is a MATLAB toolbox running on the Ubuntu system, which calls the Linux shell scripts and Python scripts to complete the whole analysis pipeline. It was developed by Gaoxing Zheng. We are very grateful to Prof. He Wang for his technical guidance in multi-modal MRI preprocessing and post-processing. We also thank Prof. Xin Wang and Prof. Jing Ding for providing a good hardware and software platform as well as clinical resources.

The UFA toolbox is designed for multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis of brain white matter diseases. It enables the automatic extraction of WMHs and establishes an automatic tracking and quantification scheme for superficial U-fibers, helping clinicians combine the T2 FLAIR image and DWI information to understand the white matter lesions with different etiologies. It may help clinicians to identify early white matter damage that is not visible to the naked eye on T2 FLAIR images.

## Requirements

The following table lists the open-source tools that need to be installed in advance to successfully use the UFA toolbox (Table 1). We have detailed instructions on how to successfully install the required open-source tools and how to successfully use the UFA toolbox in the ‘UFA_toolbox_tutorial.pdf’ file.
